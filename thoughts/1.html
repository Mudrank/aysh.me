        Time Spent ≠ Achieved Success
      </h1>
      <h3 style="margin-top: 10vh">
        In her book ‘Stay Hungry Stay Foolish’ Rashmi Bansal underlined a really
        important learning - only if the founders of MakeMyTrip.com may have
        tried to work on making their website look better, they might have lost
        their chance of becoming the success they are today.<br /><br />

        Last month, I had my first ‘successful’ product launch in recent times.
        (Note: I’ve added successful in apostrophe, more on that later). The
        product was
        <a
          href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/side-domains"
          class="highlight"
          >Side Domains</a
        >
        If you’re unaware of it, it is a simple marketplace to sell brandable
        domains you no longer use. It was a roar, relatively to my other
        projects. It even started bringing in revenue from the first week -
        quite uncommon for most of my projects, I keep almost all
        functionalities free. None of my products has ever been so widely
        accepted before, perhaps maybe because this was the first time I did not
        target a niche, but it still did exceptionally well.<br /><br />
        I spend only a few hours making the project, but it still did way better
        than any of my projects. After this product launch, I learned a hard to
        accept reality —> The time and effort you put into your project is never
        proportional to the level of success you achieve. Before continuing, let
        me address the use of apostrophe with successful. Googling up the term
        gives a nice definition - “*the accomplishment of an aim or purpose*” -
        but the meaning behind this definition isn’t really declarative.
        ‘Success’ as a word can have a really broad meaning. For someone, it can
        be a positive cash flow, for another it can be better revenues, and for
        the third person, it can be as simple as gaining the ‘internet points’.
        It can be anything that you want it to achieve. For me, success was
        purely internet popularity, however, this article should apply to what
        most people perceive success to be - revenue and/or popularity.<br /><br />

        Usually, people like think you have to ‘polish it until it shines’
        before you launch. That’s the reason you’re gonna find people saying
        they spent their sleepless nights building this but it still didn’t take
        off. That’s where the mistake lies. Time isn’t the only factor that
        affects the success of your product. In fact, in some cases, the amount
        of time spent may not even matter. This is because time in itself
        doesn’t tell a lot about itself. When you start asking deeper questions,
        you should be able to start getting to the factors that *actually*
        matter. There are a few more reasons which could have caused a
        not-so-good launch :<br /><br />

        - <b>Quality and Efficiency</b>: The number one reason why your project
        might have failed is because of your efficiency or quality of work. When
        you compare the number of hours of work to others you should keep in
        mind that each person works differently. What you do in 3 hours can be
        done in just 2 hours by some other person.<br /><br />
        - <b>Usability and Timing</b>: Not a lot of people are going to buy a
        car with a steam-powered engine now. Neither are they going to buy a car
        that gives a really good mileage on Jupiter. Your project should remove
        a pain point that people face, or add value to their current
        situation.<br /><br />
        - <b>Language</b>: Your language may have not been appealing enough to
        the people you marketed to - Product development is only half of the
        struggle you have to deal with. One of the most important and often
        neglected tasks is to use the right language. With proper use of
        language, you can make even a shabby product look good.<br /><br />
        - <b>Unrealistic Goals:</b> Your success even depends on how realistic
        your definition of success is. You should keep in mind your market size,
        the kind of problem you’re solving, the availability of your project
        (country, platform, etc.), and a lot of similar factors before you
        decide what success is for you.<br /><br />

        This is not an exhaustive list of the possible reasons. But when you
        start thinking in this direction, you will definitely find the right
        thing to focus on.<br />
